# Terminal-Mart
#TerminalMart is a command-line interface (CLI) application built with Java and powered by JDBC. It simulates an online shopping experience right within your terminal. Users can browse through a curated collection of products, add items to their cart, and complete secure transactions seamlessly. With its intuitive text-based interface, TerminalMart brings the convenience of e-commerce to the command line, enabling users to shop efficiently without leaving their preferred development environment. This project showcases the power of Java and JDBC in creating interactive, database-driven applications that blend functionality with a retro, text-based user experience.
